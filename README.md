Finding how much memory does a object consume.

Today's repo is about finding how much memory a object in python consumes.

So the takeaway is while programming in python you can know how much difference it's makes and so0 choosing right data type could possibly lead to a clean and optimized code.

code

    size_1 = ["I","am","groot"]
    size_2 = ("I","am","groot")

here we took a list and a tuple let's find out how much memory they consume for same amount of data.

output:

    size of list: 120
    size of tuple: 64

<h2>The below are some of my work which can help you design more optimized code</h2>
